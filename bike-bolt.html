            Bike Bolt is a concept app that aims to improve the transaction
            between the cyclist and the local bike shops. This project involves
            team building, concept design, and critical analytic research.

            Early iteration, my team and I were tasked to design a prototype app
            that should solve people’s problems. We begin to focus the app’s direction
            towards helping the needs of cyclists in the Vancouver area. After our brainstorm
            stage, we eventually settled with the theme of bike repairs.

            I took the role of product manager for the team and settled the team’s goal, which is to
            make the app help cyclists in any level of experience that may beconcerned or interested
            in the state of their bicycle.

            In our second stage of development, we wanted
            to focus on the meaning of accessible user
            experience for cyclists. I began my user research
            by doing both quantitative and qualitative
            research, such as personal interviews with
            general online surveys. Then I proceed to
            evaluate the data I was given to look for design
            possibilities that can appeal to the issues
            presented in the data
          </p>

            The data revealed that cyclists in Vancouver
            could sometimes experience inconsistency
            when it comes to bike repairs; some bike shops
            in Vancouver was known for being more offline.
            We eventually settled with four main core
            features starting with purchasing new bike parts,
            access to location services, a bike profile/ virtual
            garage, and a bike part history.

            There were several challenges met along the
            way, such as information presentation,
            functional or esthetic design decisions, colour
            scheme. I tasked myself to complete the
            feature to buy bike parts and focus on ensuring
            the potential user does not get confused
            throughout the purchasing process.

            I want the app was to be powerful, dynamic,
            modern and easy to use. The result was that
            the final interface was clean, comfortable to
            follow, and the new feedback that was given
            was overall positive.
