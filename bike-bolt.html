          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>
            In a group of 6, the team is required to develop a mockup app with any topic.
            After brainstorming, the team decided to design an app that can help out cyclists.
            After the ideation process and feedback we received from our survey, the group settled
            with streamlining the online and offline bike repair experience at local Vancouver bike shops.
          </p>


          <h6>Time Frame</h6>
          <p>
            The project started during the second half of the course.
            The team has to prepare a website or video presentation
            to showcase the concept, development, and interactive mockups
            of the concept app from late October to early December.

            The given task is to design a prototype app that should solve people’s problems.
            We begin to focus the app’s direction towards helping the needs of cyclists in
            the Vancouver area. After our brainstorm stage, we eventually settled with the
            theme of bike repairs.

            which is to make the app help cyclists in any level of experience that may
            be concerned or interested in the state of their bicycle.

          <p>
            In our second stage of development, we wanted to focus on the
            meaning of accessible user experience for cyclists. For my role in the team, I began doing
            both quantitative online surveys and qualitative interviews for user research to gather information.
            Then I proceed to evaluate the data to look for design possibilities
            that can address the issues.

            The data revealed that cyclists in Vancouver could sometimes experience inconsistency,
            especially when it comes to bike repairs; some bike shops in Vancouver are known for
            being more casual. We eventually settled with four main core features: purchasing
            new bike parts, access to location services, a bike profile/ virtual garage, and a bike part history.

            <h6>Development process</h6>
            <p>
              Each development iterations, the team often 
              looked back and asked which features are to
               stay or remove. At a certain point the team 
               was very ambitious and were overloaded with 
               the amount of work at a given time, which results
                to design misdirection and team mismanagement. 
                To prevent this, I tasked the team to focus on the 
                core functions of the app. By narrowing the app's 
                scope, I can lay out each specific task for my members
                 so they can stay on track and complete it before the 
                 designated deadline. Near the end of the development cycle, 
                 I decided to redesign the overal color scheme and design 
                 direction as the overall esthetics and usability were up to my expectations.

          <h4>Final Prototype</h4>

          <p>
            There are several challenges met along the way, such as information presentation,
            functional or esthetic design decisions, and color scheme. I tasked myself to
            complete a feature where the user can buy bike parts and ensuring that the purchasing
            process is in depth and easy to use. I want the app was to be powerful, dynamic,
            modern and easy to use. Overall, the final interface was clean, comfortable to
            follow, and the new feedback that was given was overall positive.

          <h4>Thoughts & Takeaways</h4>
          <p>
            During the weekly development process, I learned that it is 
            important to know whether or not other team members are enthusiastic about the project.
            Due to a large team size, several designers or developers may have different working attitude
            and priorities, and that as a developer, I cannot high expectation on working speed and work ethics. 
            This project has also enabled me to get comfortable do user interviews, conduct and provide research results, and prepare
            research arguments to explain why several design choices made by the team are valid.
